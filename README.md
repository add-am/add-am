##  Hi, I’m Adam Shand, a data analyst experienced in R and Python. Currently I am creating end-to-end scripts for environmental data collected from the Great Barrier Reef. Head over to [Dry Tropics Partnership for Healthy Waters](https://drytropicshealthywaters.org/) to see some of my publications.
